# Redis on k8s testcase

In this readme, you will find out how to run a memtier benchmark on a cluster of k8s-hosted Redis servers. 

## The test environment details

* Dedicated LAN or back-to-back (b2b) connection is used for benchmark traffic
* MacVTap interface is used to avoid the performance penalty of linux bridge 
* Client and server machines are coupled using their NUMA-respective NICs (memtier_benchmark in a k8s container resides in the client machine whereas k8s with Redis database instance reside in the server machine) 
* k8s's are created from pre-existing qcow2 images and use cloud-init configdrives for a basic set-up
* Most of the software runs in k8s containers, the OS is Linux
* Consul is a DNS-based service discovery. (www.consul.io)
  * If you want to check if the Redis service is up and running, you can use Consul that runs on each virtual machine. Consul originates from the server machine and runs as an agent on each k8s.
  *  We use Consul to discover IPsâ€™ of Redis services in the stages of populating Redis databases and running the benchmark. 
* You can optionally export benchmark results to an S3 bucket

## Prework

You will need two machines: a client and a server. Once you physically set up your machines, you will have to configure them in order to run the memtier benchmark.
